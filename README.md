# homebridge-calendar

A calendar plugin for [homebridge](https://github.com/nfarina/homebridge), which allows flexible scheduling of triggers using any iCal calendar.

HomeKits own scheduling means are limited and in some instances not flexible enough for more advanced scheduling needs. This plugin integrates any iCal calendar (iCloud, Google Calendar, ...) into HomeKit and creates stateless switches for the events in the calendar using the scheduled event summary.

## Supported calendars

- iCloud Calendar
- Google Calendar

In theory any calendar solution that supports iCal ([RFC 5545](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5545)) and sharing should work, however some vendors choose to deviate from the RFC in their implementation. If you use one that works, but isn't on the list - great please add it to this README.md.

## Installation

After [Homebridge](https://github.com/nfarina/homebridge) has been installed:

 ```sudo npm install -g homebridge-calendar --unsafe-perm```

## Configuration

```json
{
  "bridge": {
      ...
  },
  "platforms": [
    {
      "platform": "Calendar",
      "calendars": [
        {
          "name": "Cal 1",
          "url": "webcal://",
          "pollingInterval": 5,
          "offset": "-8h",
          "sensors": [
            "Sensor 1",
            "Sensor 2"
          ]
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

| Attributes | Usage |
|------------|-------|
| name | A unique name for the calendar. Will be used as the accessory name and default switch for any calendar events. |
| url | The address of the calender. Can be a `webcal://`, a `http://` or an `https://` URL. |
| pollingInterval | The polling interval the plugin uses to retrieve calendar updates in minutes. If not set, the plugin will update the calendar once every 15 minutes. |
| sensors | An array of event summaries to create special sensors for. |

The above example creates the plugin with three contact sensors:

- Cal 1
- Sensor 1
- Sensor 2

`Cal 1` will be opened any time any event starts in the calendar. `Sensor 1` and `Sensor 2` will only open if the event name starts with `Sensor 1` or `Sensor 2` respectively.

Calendar events may overlap, may be full day, recurring or single occurance events and can even span multiple days.

### Offset

You might want to trigger the sensors earlier than the scheduled event. This can be done by applying an offset to the calendar. An offset specifies the time to subtract from the scheduled start of the event. The offset essentially moves the start date ahead by the specified amount of time. The end date of the events is unaffected. Essentially this extends the event duration by the offset.

#### Offset syntax

An offset is a combination of a number and a postfix that indicates the unit of time to move. The supported offset postfixes are the following:

| Postfix | Example | Description |
|---------|---------|-------------|
| d       | 2d      | Make an event start earlier by two days. |
| h       | 8h      | Make an event start earlier by eight hours. |
| m       | 15m     | Make an event start earlier by fifteen minutes. |
| s       | 10s     | Make an event start earlier by ten seconds. |

An offset is always negative, e.g. it moves the start to an earlier time. You can specify the minus in front of the offset. Positive offsets (with a plus symbol in front) to move to a later time are not supported.

### Sharing an iCloud calender

To give the plugin access to a calender it is advised to create a seperate (iCloud) calender and share it publically. Public sharing provides a read-only view on the calender and a URL that can be used by the plugin to access the calender. No one else can modify a publically shared calender in this way.

[Here's good instructions](http://www.idownloadblog.com/2016/02/14/how-to-share-calendars-iphone-ipad-mac-iclod/) on how to do this. Refer to the public sharing section there.
